                    <h3 class="heading-3">JAVA SWING</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">As part of my learning journey in Java programming, I decided to explore Java
                        Swing, a user interface toolkit for creating desktop applications. I watched tutorials on
                        YouTube to learn how to use Java Swing and applied my new knowledge to create three simple
                        applications. </p>
                    <div class=" application application1">
                        <h4 class="heading-4">Application1</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">The first application is a simple computer program that shows how the mouse is used on a computer screen which I shortly call “Mouse_Position”. It has three parts: the listener, the model, and the view. The listener listens to the mouse events, like clicking or moving the mouse, and tells the program what to do. The model keeps track of the mouse's position and how many times it has been clicked. The view is what you see on the computer screen, and it shows the mouse's position, how many times it has been clicked, and whether the mouse is inside or outside the program window. </p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="application application2">
                        <h4 class="heading-4">Application2</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">The second application is a program that creates a counter with buttons to increase, decrease and reset its value. It has three parts: the listener, the model, and the view. The model keeps track of the current value of the counter and provides methods to change it. The view creates the graphical user interface for the counter with buttons to interact with the counter and displays the current value. The listener listens for button clicks and calls the appropriate method on the model to update the counter value.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="application application3">
                        <h4 class="heading-4">Application3</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">The third application is a small program called "Press Num". It has three main parts: the model, the view, and the listener. This code creates a small program called "Press Num". It has three main parts: the model, the view, and the listener. The model keeps track of a single integer value, which starts at 0. The view is the user interface that the user interacts with. It has four buttons labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a label that displays the last button pressed. The listener is what happens when a button is pressed. It checks which button was pressed and updates the model accordingly. Then, it updates the label on the view to display the new value of the model. So, when you run this program and click one of the four buttons, the number on the button is displayed in the label.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">100days CSS is a website which help to improve and practice CSS skills for web development. As its name, there are 100 challenges but honestly, I have not finished them all. So in this artifact, I am showcasing two of my favorite challenges from the 100days CSS website which are day 3 and day 6.</p>
                    <div class="application application1">
                        <h4 class="heading-4">Day 3</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">For day 3, this CSS challenge showcases an animated scene with a sun, a sky, a pyramid, a shadow, and a ground. The layout is created with flexbox and uses absolute positioning to layer the elements on top of each other. The sun and the sky move in an animation that makes it look like the sun is setting. The pyramid is shaded using a clipping path and changes color along with the sky. The shadow on the ground also moves in an animation to mimic the sun setting. The ground has a fading sand effect that changes color along with the sky. Overall, this challenge demonstrates the use of CSS to create an engaging and interactive scene.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">For day 6, This is a web page that displays a profile card for Anh Thu who is my girlfriend. It includes an image of Anh Thu, her name, title, and some basic statistics about her social media presence (number of posts, likes, and followers). The design of the profile card features a circle border effect around the image, a gradient background, and buttons for following and messaging Anh Thu. The code includes HTML markup and CSS styling to achieve the desired design.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">This is a web page that displays a collection of images in a special way. Instead of just showing all the images at once, the images are displayed one at a time and can be scrolled through using arrows. The images also have a special effect applied to them that makes them look more interesting. This effect makes the current image larger and more prominent, while the other images become smaller and more transparent. This creates a sense of depth and motion that makes the page more engaging to look at.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-3">JAVA COLLECTIONS AND MAP</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">During my studies, I learned about Java collections and map. I gained an understanding of how these data structures work, and how they can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently. The purpose of learning about Java collections and map was to expand my knowledge of data structures and how they can be applied to solve programming problems. This knowledge will be beneficial in my future programming projects, allowing me to choose the appropriate data structure for a given problem. Specifically, I have done three program and each of which uses Array List, Tree Map, Hash Set.</p>
                    <div class="application application1">
                        <h4 class="heading-4">Array List</h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">This is a Java program that simulates a system for managing a list of students. The program allows the user to add new students, print the list of students, check if the list is empty, find a student by their code, remove a student by their code, and sort the list of students by grade. The program also allows the user to save the list of students to a file.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">This program is a simple dictionary built using a TreeMap in Java. It allows users to add, remove, search, print all, and clear words in the dictionary. The user interface is a console-based menu that prompts the user for input and displays the appropriate output. The program uses a Map data structure to store the dictionary entries and provides methods to manipulate and query the data.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">This is a Java program for a lottery game. The user can add, remove, find, and clear coupons, as well as see the total number of coupons and print all the coupons in the box. The program uses a set to store the coupons, and the user can also do a lottery to randomly select a coupon from the box. The program is run from the command line and uses a menu to prompt the user for their choices.</p>

                    <P class="paragraph">This is an unfinished ePortfolio web page I first made after 1 month learning HTML and CSS which you are seeing now, this may or may not be reused by me in the future as I personally find it not so well-done. I’m still proud of making this web page. The Web page include many html files linked together and being CSS as best as I could at the time. This unfinished web page contains main page and portfolio page which store my first 8 artifacts and anecdotes and presentations for each of them.</P>
